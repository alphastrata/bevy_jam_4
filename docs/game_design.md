# Flora the Corporation

"Welcome to PIELO Corp."

## Overview

You are building a base on an (alien?) planet to extract all the resources. The flora is hostile. You have to protect the base while also expanding to get more/rarer resources.

The plants are literally out to kill you. But you need those sweet, sweet CORPORATION POINTS!

## Mechanics / Systems

### Random World Gen

You start at the (center/edge?) of a randomly generated world. Close to you is safer with common resources. Further out is dangerous, but with more and rarer resources.

### Wind

Wind blows pollen and seeds around and into your base.

Wind isn't constant and changes over time.

Possible systems:

- Gusts of wind that travel across the map
- Changes are more frequent during storms
- Wind changes direction over time, so defences for one wind direction won't always be viable

#### MVP

Flat direction.

#### Ideal

Swirls, changes, gusts, etc...

### Seeds

Seeds create plants. When a seed lands, it disappears, but later a plant will grow/appear to start causing havoc.

Part of the system is that seeds will land in places you don't notice, and suddenly you'll have problems to deal with to clean them up.

### Pollen

Pollen is created by plants. There is just a constant pollen spawner around any plant. The larger the plant (e.g., mature trees), the bigger/denser the pollen cloud.

Pollen damages your equipment. It's probably acidic pollen or something.

Pollen also causes nearby plants to generate more seeds.

#### MVP

Basically just above

#### Ideal

More complex interactions between plants and pollen.

### Plants & Growth

Plants grow over time.

There are different plants.

Plants aren't terribly dangerous on their own, but they spawn seeds and pollen, which IS terribly dangerous.

#### MVP

#### Ideal

- Trees germinate in other trees
  - These trees will germinate in buildings and destroy them

### Resources

Building structures and defences requires resources.

#### MVP

#### Ideal

### Machinery

You can build different machines. The three goals of machines are:

1. Gather resource(s)
2. Defend against pollen
3. Destroy encroaching flora

#### MVP

One single machine that harvests trees.

#### Ideal

Different machines, different strengths

### Power Grid/Tree/Web

Reminiscent of cancer growing across the planet. You build branching power lines.

Machines can only work within your power web.

Pollen degrades power nodes.
