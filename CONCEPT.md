Game Jam Theme: **That's a LOT of Entities!**

## Overall concept

Deforest the plant for Maximum Profit.

> "The Company thanks you for your participation in the [PlanetName] Environmental Rehabilitation Program. Your contribution has been logged."

**Themes:** deforestation, greenwashing

**How to tie into theme:** Massive number of trees and tree seed particles on the map at any one time.

## Gameplay

#### Core

- Trees/forests grow outwards in a ring except where blocked by terrain.
- There is a countdown for a new forest to randomly spawn.
- The more trees you cut, the more **Corporation Points** you receive.
- Players can spend Corporation Points to place one of a few types of towers that actively destroy trees.

#### Extra

- Weather events similarly have a countdown that can be forecast by having a **Weather radar tower**. Weather events allow you to predict where the new forests will spawn making them no longer random to you.
- Visualisation for the above could be quite cool and tie into the theme by showing 10s of thousands of tree seeds moving with the wind.
- Trees have stages of growth; the earlier in a trees growth cycle the easier it is to destroy.

#### Towers and abilities

- Fire Tower
- Chainsaw Tower
- Weather Tower - Forecast weather events
- "Tesla" Tower - Zaps smaller trees into oblivion but can't handle larger trees
- Nutrient depleter tower? (stops them from growing)

**One-off abilities:**  
- Bee sterlisation

## Art

Not quite decided but probably 2D with a top-down camera and 3/4 perspective (is this what its called?) assets.
